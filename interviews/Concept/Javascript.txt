'use strict'
    -The "use strict" directive switches the engine to the 
    “modern” mode, changing the behavior of some built-in 
    features. We’ll see the details later in the tutorial.

let, var, const
    -let 
        -Creating a variable (named storage for data).
    -var instead of let 
        -Var is in a slightly different, 'old-school' way
    -const  
        -const is like let but the value of the variable can't be changed

String
    Double quotes and Single quotes 
        -"Hello" & 'Hello' are same in Javascript
    Backticks
        -`Hello` allows to embed variables and expressions into a string by
        wrapping them in ${...}
        -Ex:
        ```Javascript
            let name = "John"
            alert(`Hello, ${name}`); //Hello, John 
        ```
